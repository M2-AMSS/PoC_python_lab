This format provides a **triangular representation of a 3-dimensional surface geometry**. The surface is broken down into a series of small triangles call facets. Each facet is identified by a normal unit vector (perpendicular to the facet and with a length of 1.0) and by three vertices (corners of the triangle). \n",
